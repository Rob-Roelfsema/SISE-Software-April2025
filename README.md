# SISE-Software-April2025
SISE Software release, April 2025

The SISE-Monitor and SISE-Analysis applications are LabView-based programs that enable ion flux measurements with ion-selective microelectrodes. A manuscript that described this software has uploaded to  BioRxiv's (https://www.biorxiv.org/) and will be submitzted to a scientific Journal. Note, that a thrird application is provided named SISE-Monitor100-Demo, which can be used to test the SISE-Monitor application, without the need to invest time and money into a micromanipulator for movment control of the microelectrode, or an A/D converter for sampling the volatge data from the microelectrode amplifier.
