# SISE-Software-April2025
SISE Software release, April 2025

The SISE-Monitor and SISE-Analysis applications are LabView-based programs that enable ion flux measurements with ion-selective microelectrodes. A manuscript that described this software has uploaded to BioRxiv's (https://www.biorxiv.org/) and will be submitted to a scientific Journal. Note, that a third application is provided named SISE-Monitor100-Demo, which can be used to test the SISE-Monitor application, without the need to invest time and money into a micromanipulator for movement control of the microelectrode, or an A/D converter for sampling the voltage data from the microelectrode amplifier.

All SISE-programs are provided in the branches of the main window; as Windows executable (*.exe) files in the SISE-Windows-Applications(*.exe) branch and LabView (*.vi) in the SISE-Virtual-Instrument(VI)-files branch. The Windows executable files need support of the LabView Runtime engine (version 2025Q1) that can be downloaded from the NI -Website (https://www.ni.com/). The virtual instrument (*.vi) files only can be opened with NI-LabView, such as the community edition, which is free for non-commercial use. In addition, the virtual instrument applications make use of SubVIâ€™s, which are provided in the SISE-Submodules-(Vis) branch.
